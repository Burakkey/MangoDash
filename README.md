# MangoDash
---
MangoDash is a java project that allows users to link their social media accounts to view key insights, statistics, and graphs. 

## 🥭 Inspiration
We wanted to create a simple and intuitive way for social media influencers to track their analytics all in one place. MangoDash allows for the potential to perform cross platform comparisons, and to track growth over time.

## 🔍 What it does
Users can signup or create a new account within our database, using their facebook or instagram API key. Then they are able to quickly view stats such as their friend count, total likes, average likes, max likes, total comments, average comments, max comments along with bar graphs of their likes and comments per post.

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Burakkey/MangoDash.git
cd MangoDash
```
2. Open up the application in a java editor such as Intelliji
3. Run the Main file under src/app/Main.java

## ⛵ What's next for MangoDash
Features we'd like to implement into MangoDash in the future
- [ ] More social media platforms (currently we only integrate with facebook or instagram)
- [ ] Simplify API Token process (streamline the process to get the API key for the user, perhaps logging into the platform through MangoDash)
- [ ] Add more statistics (adding a page to look at general statistics cross platforms, tracking average like growth over time etc)
- [ ] Adding a ranking system
